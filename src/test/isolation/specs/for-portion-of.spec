# UPDATE/DELETE FOR PORTION OF test
#
# Test inserting temporal leftovers from a FOR PORTION OF update/delete.
#
# In READ COMMITTED mode, concurrent updates/deletes to the same records cause
# weird results. Portions of history that should have been updated/deleted don't
# get changed. That's because the leftovers from one operation are added too
# late to be seen by the other. EvalPlanQual will reload the changed-in-common
# row, but it won't re-scan to find new leftovers.
#
# MariaDB similarly gives undesirable results in READ COMMITTED mode (although
# not the same results). DB2 doesn't have READ COMMITTED, but it gives correct
# results at all levels, in particular READ STABILITY (which seems closest).
#
# A workaround is to lock the part of history you want before changing it (using
# SELECT FOR UPDATE). That way the search for rows is late enough to see
# leftovers from the other session(s). This shouldn't impose any new deadlock
# risks, since the locks are the same as before. Adding a third/fourth/etc.
# connection also doesn't change the semantics. The READ COMMITTED tests here
# use that approach to prove that it's viable and isn't vitiated by any bugs.
# Incidentally, this approach also works in MariaDB.
#
# We run the same tests under REPEATABLE READ and SERIALIZABLE.
# In general they do what you'd want with no explicit locking required, but some
# orderings raise a concurrent update/delete failure (as expected). If there is
# a prior read by s1, concurrent update/delete failures are more common.
#
# We test updates where s2 updates history that is:
#
# - non-overlapping with s1,
# - contained entirely in s1,
# - partly contained in s1.
#
# We don't need to test where s2 entirely contains s1 because of symmetry:
# we test both when s1 precedes s2 and when s2 precedes s1,  so that scenario is
# covered.
#
# We test various orderings of the update/delete/commit from s1 and s2.
# Note that `s1lock s2lock s1change` is boring because it's the same as
# `s1lock s1change s2lock`. In other words it doesn't matter if something
# interposes between the lock and its change (as long as everyone is following
# the same policy).
